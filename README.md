Marmeladdy - cross check data from excel, then interpret based on fuzzy if there are similiarities, and send result. In this case its check mock logs if there is probability of brute-force attack or it's just an user error (wrong input)

How to:

pip install -r requirments.txt\n
python3 mockdata.py\n
python3 main.py

Should work.
